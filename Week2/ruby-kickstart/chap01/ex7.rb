# given a string, return the character after every letter "r"
#
# pirates_say_arrrrrrrrr("are you really learning Ruby?") # => "eenu"
# pirates_say_arrrrrrrrr("Katy Perry is on the radio!")   # => "rya"
# pirates_say_arrrrrrrrr("Pirates say arrrrrrrrr")        # => "arrrrrrrr"

# My Solution
def pirates_say_arrrrrrrrr(string)
	newstring = ""
	for i in 0..(string.length-2)
		newstring += string[i+1] if string[i] == "r" || string[i] == "R"
	end
	newstring[0..-1]
end

# Suggested Solution
def pirates_say_arrrrrrrrr(string)
  to_return = ""
  add_next = false
  string.size.times do |index|
    current_char = string[index,1] # the second param here tells it to get a str of length 1. This is only necessary on 1.8. If you are on 1.9, just go with string[index]
    to_return << current_char if add_next
    add_next = (current_char == "r" || current_char == "R")
  end
  to_return
end
